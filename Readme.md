# 🔐 Encrypted Communication  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project simulates **encrypted communication** between a client and a server.  

## ⚙️ Functionalities  
The application provides the following core functionalities:  
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Implements the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to generate a shared secret key.  
- **Symmetric Encryption:** Encrypts communication using permutation and shuffling techniques based on the secret key.  
- **Database Authentication:** Users must log in to the server before communication; credentials are stored in a database.
